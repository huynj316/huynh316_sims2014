Final:
* Attention and Meditation values read by the Neurosky biofeedback sensor are controlling the movement of the particles attraction and repulsion.
* Blinking turns on and off the background, to see trails of the particles movements.
* The volume is controlled by the user's attention level.(Note: sound is currently broken and commented out).
* This prototype uses particles in place of paramecium, and explores using brianwaves to control their movements

Midterm Controls:
* a = turns off background
* d = turns on background
